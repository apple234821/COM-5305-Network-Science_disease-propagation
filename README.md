# Simulate-dieases-propagation
Network science

## Introduction:
This is a simulation for dieases propagation.<br>
Using differernt centrality measurement to see how can we remove the nodes. <br>
It can help us to have vaccination shot that prevent dieases break out.<br>

## Datasets
The datasets is from SNAP facebook-ego(https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html)
