# Simulate-dieases-propagation
Network science

Introduction:
This is a simulation for dieases propagation.\n
Using differernt centrality measurement to see how can we remove the nodes. \n
It can help us to have vaccination shot that prevent dieases break out.\n

The datasets is from SNAP facebook-ego(https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html)
